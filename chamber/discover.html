                <h3>Messa Falls</h3>
                <img src="images/mesafalls.webp" alt="Event Image" loading= "lazy">
                <p>At Upper Mesa Falls, a thunderous curtain of water – as tall as a 10-story building – pours over remnants of an ancient volcanic super-eruption. A mile south, Lower Mesa Falls repeats the performance, the river continually chiseling away at the solidified ash and lava. The beautiful Upper and Lower Mesa Falls are the last prominent waterfalls on the Snake River unaffected by manmade influences. A scenic walking path leads to excellent viewpoints.</p>

                <h3>Rexburg Tabernacle </h3>
                <img src="images/tabernacle.webp" alt="Event Image" loading= "lazy">
                <p>The Rexburg Tabernacle was built in 1911 and served as meeting house for religious services until it was acquired by the City of Rexburg in 1980 and turned into a civic center. The two shades of rock used in the construction were quarried on the Rexburg Bench and in the Lyman area south of Rexburg. The Tabernacle was placed in the National Register in 1974 citing its uniqueness in Idaho, both by virtue of its style and its association with the Mormon settlement. Architecturally, it is one of the very few Italianate church buildings in the state, and vastly exceeds all others in that style in character, size and imaginative use of stone.</p>
