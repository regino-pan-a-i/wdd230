            <p>When comparing what iPhone to buy, apple hase done a good job on presenting their information in a way that is easy and 
                understandable for the reader. There might be a lot of details to consider when choosing a phone, but they do not fill
                up the page with as much information as they can fit, it is intentional to focus on little facts at a time.
